LODSight is an RDF dataset summarisation tool.

It consists of a Java project that runs a set of SPARQL queries against a given endpoint.
Based on query results, a summarisation is stored in an SQL database.

There are two frontend web apps that can visualize the summarization.

* New responsive GUI - not available on github, but will be deployed on a separate site soon.
